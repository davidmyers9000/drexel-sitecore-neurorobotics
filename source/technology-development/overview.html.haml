    %h5 Patent Pending ‘Neuronal Mechanisms Underlying Seizure Generation in an Animal Model of Chronic Epilepsy’, US Provisional Patent Application No. 61/492,173
    %p Filed June 1, 2011, Pending
    %p <strong>Abstract:</strong> The present invention describes systems and methods for predicting and detecting a seizure in a subject. The methods of the invention comprise measuring interneuron synchrony in terms of the coherence between interneuron action potentials and local field potential oscillations. In one embodiment, the detection of specific patterns of coherence, correlation, and firing rate of interneurons predicts an upcoming seizure.

    %h5 Patent Awarded ‘Wireless Controlled Neuromodulation System’, US Patent No. 8,086,316
    %p Filed May 24, 2007, Awarded September 6, 2011
    %p <strong>Abstract:</strong> An apparatus is disclosed for controlled neuromodulation. The apparatus includes a plurality of neural sensors, wherein each of the neural sensors is electrically connected to a separate signal conditioner. Each of the signal conditioners produces a neural sensor signal, which is analyzed by a separate threshold detector to produces a neural event signal when the neural sensor signal exceeds a threshold level associated with the threshold detector. Each of the threshold detectors is connected to a wireless transceiver and the wireless transceivers transmit the neural event signals to a processor. The processor analyzes the neural event signals and determines the presence or absence of a clinical brain state. The apparatus can be used to detect and control epileptic seizures.

    %h5 Patent Pending 'Method to quantitatively measure effect of psychotropic drugs on sensory discrimination', Serial No. 60/760,211
    %p Filed Date January 19, 2006, Pending
    %p <strong>Abstract:</strong> A method for evaluating an effect of a psychotropic compound or a treatment on a neuronal activity of an animal including determining a change in the amount of information generated by neurons in response to at least one repeatedly applied stimulus, wherein the change is caused by administering the psychotropic compound or a treatment. Also provided is a method of screening psychotropic compounds for effectiveness on an animal which involves using a change in sensory discrimination in a population of neurons of the animal, wherein the sensory discrimination is obtained in response to one or more stimuli repeatedly applied to the animal and wherein a change in the sensory discrimination occurs due to administering said psychotropic compounds to the animal.

    %h5 Patent Awarded 'Ceramic based multi-site electrode arrays and methods for their production', US Patent No. 6,834,200
    %p Filed October 19, 2001, Awarded Dec 21, 2004
    %p <strong>Abstract:</strong> Ceramic based multi-site electrode arrays of a polished ceramic substrate patterned with recording sites and bonding pads which are connected via conducting lines are provided. Methods for producing these electrode arrays and using the electrode arrays to record or stimulate multiple neurons in a mammal are also provided.
