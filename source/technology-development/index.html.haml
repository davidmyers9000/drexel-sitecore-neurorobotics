    %h5 Patent Awarded ‘Ceramic based multi-site electrode arrays and methods for their production’, 6,834,200, Filing Date, October 19, 2001
    %p <strong>Abstract:</strong> Ceramic based multi-site electrode arrays of a polished ceramic substrate patterned with recording sites and bonding pads, which are connected via conducting lines, are provided. Methods for producing these electrode arrays and using the electrode arrays to record or stimulate multiple neurons in a mammal are also provided.

    %h5 Patent Awarded ‘Wireless Controlled Neuromodulation System’, US Patent No. 8,086,316, Filed May 24, 2007
    %p <strong>Abstract:</strong> An apparatus is disclosed for controlled neuromodulation. The apparatus includes a plurality of neural sensors, wherein each of the neural sensors is electrically connected to a separate signal conditioner. Each of the signal conditioners produces a neural sensor signal, which is analyzed by a separate threshold detector to produces a neural event signal when the neural sensor signal exceeds a threshold level associated with the threshold detector. Each of the threshold detectors is connected to a wireless transceiver and the wireless transceivers transmit the neural event signals to a processor. The processor analyzes the neural event signals and determines the presence or absence of a clinical brain state. The apparatus can be used to detect and control epileptic seizures.
